# Grading System using Tree in java

The Grading System application is a simple yet efficient tool designed to manage student records, specifically focusing on their names and grades. It utilizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure to store the student data, ensuring that the system can quickly add, delete, search, and display student information in an organized manner.
This application allows users to manage a student database, where each student has a name and a corresponding grade. The system supports the following key functionalities: adding students and their grades, searching for a student’s grade, displaying all students and their grades, and deleting student records.

What It Can Do:

1.Add Student and Grade:
The application allows users to input the student’s name and their grade, which is then stored in the tree structure. The name is stored in lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity during searches and deletions.

2.Search for a Student’s Grade:
Users can search for a student's grade by entering their name. The application will display the student’s name, grade, and whether they passed or failed based on a grade threshold of 75.

3.Display All Students and Grades:
The application displays all student records sorted alphabetically by name. It shows the student's name, grade, and pass/fail status based on the grade threshold.

4.Delete Student:
Users can delete a student's record by entering their name. The record is removed from the tree, ensuring the student no longer appears in the system.

5.Exit the System:
Users can choose to exit the application at any time, closing the program gracefully.

Why I Made This Application:

I created this application because many teachers struggle with managing large student data, especially when frequently updating or searching records. Traditional methods like spreadsheets can be time-consuming.
This app solves that by using a Binary Search Tree (BST) to organize data efficiently, speeding up tasks like grade lookup and record deletion. It helps teachers save time on administrative tasks, allowing them to focus more on teaching.
This app contributes to me by enhancing my understanding of binary search trees, data structures, and problem-solving skills. For the community, it helps teachers and institutions manage student records more efficiently, saving time on administrative tasks.
